# Pokedex
[This website](https://pongpwner.github.io/pokedex/) displays pokemon from generation 1-8 in the form of cards.
When hovering over a pokemon the card will flip over and you can see more details about the pokemon. 
You can click a card to open a modal to see even more information about the pokemon.

## Features
* Filter what pokemon are displayed by their types
* Search for pokemon by name
* Pokemon cards flip over to show basic information about the pokemon
* Clicking on a pokemon card will open a modal showing more information about the pokemon
* In the modal view, you can look at different sprites of the pokmon (front, and back, shiny form)
* Iterate through pokemon from the modal view

## Built With
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)


## What I Learned

This project was very good practice for styling and working with an api.  I combined data from multiple api calls for each pokemon. I also learned about react context by storing the pokemon data state with context. I applied a css animation to flip the pokemon card.
