## Overview
[live demo](https://pongpwner.github.io/pokedex/)

This is a Pokedex that takes data from pokeapi and displays pokemon from generation 1-8 in the form of cards.
When hovering over a pokemon the card will flip over and you can see more details about the pokemon. 
You can click a card to open a modal to see even more information about the pokemon.

## What I Learned

This project was very good practice for styling and working with an api.  I combined data from multiple api calls for each pokemon. I also learned about react context by storing the pokemon data state with context. I applied a css animation to flip the pokemon card.
